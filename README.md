A Visually Aesthetic Calculator App created using html, css, flexbox & Javascript language. I commit to commit code for 100 days everyday. I commit to make my brain feel the torture of blank text editor, write from scratch, try before copying, debugging errors, not watch tutorial after tutorial. I will do front end projects of wes bos 30 js, ecommerce websites, vuejs app clones, sonny singhania react clones, clever programmer, fcc.
